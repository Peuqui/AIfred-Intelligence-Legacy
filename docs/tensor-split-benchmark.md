## Key Findings

1. **Generation speed is 10–15% faster with 11:1 in Round 1** — when prompt context is still
   small. Minimizing layers on the slower P40 (346 GB/s vs 672 GB/s RTX 8000) reduces the
   per-token bottleneck during autoregressive generation.

2. **The advantage shrinks in Round 2 (~4%)** — as context grows, more of the generation
   time is spent in attention (which scales with sequence length). The R2 results show higher
   variance (18.8–27.2 tok/s), suggesting that output length and content complexity matter
   more than split ratio at these context sizes.

3. **Prompt processing (PP) is ~2% faster with normal 2:1 split** — PP benefits from parallel
   KV cache writes across both GPUs. With 11:1, 92% of the KV cache is written to one GPU,
   creating a bottleneck. The effect is small but consistent across all turns.

4. **TTFT is ~3% slower with the speed variant** — TTFT = PP + model overhead + first-token
   latency. Since PP is slightly slower with aggressive split, TTFT follows. The difference is
   <1s in absolute terms.

5. **Inference time ≠ generation speed** — shorter wall-clock inference does not always mean
   higher tok/s. Example: AIfred R2 speed variant finishes in 17.6s (332 tokens, 18.8 tok/s)
   vs normal in 21.0s (430 tokens, 20.5 tok/s). The speed variant is faster in wall-clock
   because it generated **fewer tokens** — not because it generated them faster. The model
   is nondeterministic, so output length varies between runs. Always compare tok/s (throughput)
   rather than inference time (which conflates throughput with output length).

6. **Overall wall-clock time is 10s shorter with the speed variant** — 113.5s vs 123.6s total.
   This reflects a combination of genuinely faster generation in R1 and nondeterministic output
   length differences across 6 turns.

## When to Use Which Configuration

| Use case | Recommended config | Reason |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| Short conversations (<8K context) | Speed (11:1, 32K) | 10–15% faster generation |
| Multi-turn tribunal (typical) | Speed (11:1, 32K) | ~10% faster overall, 32K is sufficient |
| Long conversations (>32K tokens) | Normal (2:1, 262K) | Speed variant would truncate history |
| RAG with large context | Normal (2:1, 262K) | Need full context for document retrieval |
| Batch processing (many short prompts) | Speed (11:1, 32K) | Maximizes throughput per request |

**Rule of thumb:** Use the speed variant by default. Switch to normal only when you
actually need >32K context tokens.

## Calibration Details

The speed variant was automatically calibrated by AIfred's VRAM calibration system:

- **Phase 1:** Native context test → 262,144 tokens fits with 2:1 split
- **Phase 2:** Binary search for maximum tensor split at 32K context
  - Tested 7 ratios (99:1 → 11:1), converged in ~7 minutes
  - Result: 11:1 (91.7% on RTX 8000, 8.3% on P40)
  - VRAM breakdown: CUDA0 = 35,275 MB, CUDA1 = 16,807 MB

Both configurations are stored in the llama-swap config and selectable via model name:
- `qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct-q4_k_m` → full context, balanced split
- `qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct-q4_k_m-speed` → reduced context, aggressive split
